# Adobe-XD-Projects
I have added three adobe XD projects.
1. House of paws:
Web application where users can search for available pets and adopt, they can also book for petsitters for their beloved pets.
The wireframes, prototype of design was made in Adobe XD, while we implemented the frontend on Reactjs.
The Entire XD file is attached here along with PDF of landing page for small preview.

 2. Restaurant Website:
This is a small tutorial while doing our Usability module lectures. I have added XD file as well as PDF for small preview.

3. LiveStoryteller:
Project ‘LiveStoryteller’ provides an open Digital Live Platform for people to stay safe at home and earn money by exhibiting their skills and hobbies.
This platform gives an open opportunity to user to become a ‘Presenter’ who is the narrator showcasing their skills and profession and earns money and also to become a ‘Audience’ who is the learner or the viewer and to explore other interests.
